<h1>Ramila's Portfolio :)<h1>
<h2><em>There are many things about me to know of</em></h2>


<p id="paragraph">Okay, so my name is <strong>Ramila</strong> I am in Grade 11. I was born in <strong>United States of America</strong> and when I was a couple of months old my family had shifted to <strong>Canada.</strong><br> We lived in Canada for eleven years and then we went to <strong>Pakistan</strong> for five years and now i'm back here, in Canada. I have <strong>three</strong> siblings one elder sister one<br> younger sister and one youngest brother of all. I have many<strong> hobbies</strong> in which you will get to know below. I really like the idea of <strong>computers</strong> as nowadays<br> everything is online or on a electronic device, the thing I like about this is that it's less time taking and easier to do, as some people don't know how to use<br> such things I suggest a <strong>specific</strong> device for them, in which they speak what they want on the device.
