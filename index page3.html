<p>A program is a set of step-by-step instructions that directs the computer to do the tasks you want it to do and produce the results you want. Computer programming is a way of giving computers instructions about what they should do next. These instructions are known as code, and computer programmers write code to solve problems or perform a task.</p>

<li>Programming helps you understand computers. The computer is only a tool. If you learn how to write simple programs, you will gain more knowledge about how a computer works. </li>
<li>Writing a few simple programs increases your confidence level. Many people find great personal satisfaction in creating a set of instructions that solve a problem.</li>
<li>Learning programming lets you find out quickly whether you like programming and whether you have the analytical turn of mind programmers need. Even if you decide that programming is not for you, understanding the process certainly will increase your appreciation of what programmers and computers can do. </li>

<h2>Why do people use computer programming?</h2>
<p>Programming helps to communicate and simplify things. To learn or know what is programmong there are different types of lanuguages which are; html, JavaScript, CSS, these are the only ones I know for now. Computer Programming also creates software programs by writing code and test the programs to be sure they are free of error and working fine. They also correct bugs in the code when necessary.
